# CRC Site v2

This is the new and improved website for Combat Robotics @ Cornell ヽ(・∀・)ﾉ

## Setup

First, clone the repository locally. Do this by clicking the green `Code` button and copying the URL to your clipboard. Open Visual Studio Code, and at the `Welcome` page, click `Clone Git Respository`. Paste the URL, and it will prompt you to choose a destination. Choose your CRC folder or wherever you wish to save your CRC projects. You've cloned the repo!

## Local development

Open the `site-2025` project and navigate into the /react-site dir. To run
the Vite local development server, use `npm run dev`. The site will load 
at the localhost address, updating with changes in real-time.
